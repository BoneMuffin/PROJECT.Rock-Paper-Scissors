# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Project from the Odin project: Foundations Course.
Took 46 hours approx to finish this project (so far).

What I've learned:
-Knowledge of how DOM manipulation works
-Practice and understanding of how different functions work with each other
-How global and local scope for variables works
